# RadarSignalProcessing_Ubiquitous
This repository serves as a collection of algorithms, simulations, and analytical models related to Radar Signal Processing.
It includes implementations, explorations, and solutions developed across various radar domains such as:
Detection, Estimation, and Tracking
TDOA / FDOA Localization and Geolocation
Passive and Bistatic Radar Modeling
Probability of Intercept (POI) Analysis
Doppler and Range Signal Processing Chains
Clutter Modeling and CFAR Detection

Each module focuses on conceptual clarity, analytical formulation, and practical MATLAB/Python implementation for simulation and validation purposes.
